Good day,
 
We will need the following documentation to get the process started to verify your degree at SAQA:
•	Consent for authentication of learner achievements (kindly find attached).
•	Copy of I.D. or Passport.
•	Copy of degree.
•	Letter of authorisation (kindly find attached).
These can be emailed to us in pdf format. The process for the verification takes 25 working days. If your degree is hard to verify, it may take longer than 25 working days to acquire. SAQA will notify me if this happens. 
 
PLEASE TAKE NOTE OF THE FOLLOWING: If you have applied for a SAQA verification prior to our correspondence, SAQA will email all further communication to you as your email has already been entered into the system. Please forward all emails that you receive from SAQA to me as I actively work with SAQA to get your verification done and I need all the reference numbers that have been sent to you.
